"I want to create a professional and stylish portfolio website that reflects my work and aspirations as an IT professional specializing in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), DevOps, DevSecOps, Cloud Engineering, Cybersecurity, and IT in general. The website should have a modern, clean, and tech-inspired aesthetic with an intuitive and well-structured navigation.

#### Core Features & Pages:

- Home Page: A visually appealing introduction that briefly highlights my expertise, latest projects, featured blog posts, and a call to action.

- Projects Page: A portfolio-style section where I can showcase my projects with interactive thumbnails. When I click on a project's thumbnail, I should see a dedicated page where I can put images, videos, descriptions, code, and other details relevant to that project.

- Blog Page: A structured space for my tech articles, categorized by topic, with an editable category system and a search function for easy navigation. It should also allow for future integration of a newsletter signup option.

- About Me Page: A section that includes my background, education, career aspirations, an interactive career timeline, certifications, skills, and a downloadable resume.

- Contact Page: A simple but professional contact form where recruiters, collaborators, and potential clients can reach me, along with direct links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

#### Here are some smart integrations that I want for a Seamless User Experience:

- Tech Stack Showcase: A concise display of the technologies I use, integrated into the Projects page.

- Dark Mode Toggle: Ensuring a modern and user-friendly browsing experience.

- Newsletter Signup (Future Expansion): A small section in both the blog and the footer for email capture without cluttering the main design.

- Search Functionality: Enabling visitors to easily find specific blog posts or projects.

#### Design & Aesthetic Preferences:

- A sleek and modern tech-themed design, either with a dark mode as default with vibrant accent colors or a clean, light-mode interface with soft gradients.

- A minimalist yet interactive feel, with subtle animations or terminal-style text effects to add a professional, high-tech look.

- The website should be responsive for both desktop and mobile users and easy to update without coding knowledge.

Please generate a website design that aligns with these requirements while ensuring scalability for future expansions, such as marketing products or startup services."
